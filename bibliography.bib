	Abstract = {At the National Meteorological Center (NMC), a new analysis system is being extensively tested for possible use in the operational global data assimilation system. This analysis system is called the spectral statistical-interpolation (SSI) analysis system because the spectral coefficients used in the NMC spectral model are analyzed directly using the same basic equations as statistical (optimal) interpolation. Results from several months of parallel testing with the NMC spectral model have been very encouraging. Favorable features include smoother analysis increments, greatly reduced changes from initialization, and significant improvement of 1-5-day forecasts. Although the analysis is formulated as a variational problem, the objective function being minimized is formally the same one that forms the basis of all existing optimal interpolation schemes. This objective function is a combination of forecast and observation deviations from the desired analysis, weighted by the inverses of the corresponding forecast- and observation-error covariance matrices. There are two principal differences in how the SSI implements the minimization of this functional as compared to the current OI used at NMC. First, the analysis variables are spectral coefficients instead of gridpoint values. Second, all observations are used at once to solve a single global problem. No local approximations are made, and there is no special data selection. Because of these differences, it is straightforward to include unconventional data, such as radiances, in the analysis. Currently temperature, wind, surface pressure, mixing ratio, and Special Sensor Microwave/Imager (SSM/I)total precipitable water can be used as the observation variables. Soon to be added are the scatterometer surface winds. This paper provides a detailed description of the SSI and presents a few results.},

@article{Gerritsen2005,
	Abstract = {During the weekend of Saturday 31 January to Sunday I February 1953, a storm tide raged across the northwest European shelf and flooded the low-lying coastal areas of the countries around the North Sea. The peak high waters occurred during the night and the storm surprised many people in their sleep. The resulting disaster in terms of loss of life and damage to infrastructure was enormous. In the Netherlands, 1836 people fell victim to the flood; in the UK and Belgium, the casualities were 307 and 22, respectively. The large number of fatalities in the Netherlands was related to the fact that much of the affected area is below sea-level.

This paper focuses on the case of the Netherlands. It discusses the history of land reclamation, and the fact that living in low-lying areas protected by dykes, often below sea-level, is an accepted fact of life in the Netherlands. The historical approach to dyke maintenance is then outlined, and the state of the dykes in the early twentieth century and after the war is discussed. The characteristics of the storm and the flood are discussed, along with people's experiences of the first hours and days following the flood. The impact of this human stress has often been lasting-many survivors continue to live with daily memories of the flood. Attention is given to the large-scale rescue and relief efforts, the closure of the dykes during the following nine months and the concept of the Delta Plan, designed to prevent such a large-scale disaster ever happening again. Although the 1953 storm was indeed a low probability event leading to very high storm-induced water-levels, and occurred in combination with spring tide, several arguments are presented that explain why this flood turned into a disaster of such a large scale. Equally, the question is raised whether the disaster could have been prevented. The paper concludes by noting the importance of awareness and preparedness in order to prevent a future storm threat of this scale turning into a disaster of the scope of the Big Flood of 1953.},

	(Simulating Waves Nearshore (SWAN)) has been developed, implemented,
	and validated. The model is based on a Eulerian formulation of the

	propagation over arbitrary bathymetry and current fields. It is driven
	by boundary conditions and local winds. As in other third-generation
	wave models, the processes of wind generation, whitecapping, quadruplet
	wave-wave interactions, and bottom dissipation are represented explicitly.
	In SWAN, triad wave-wave interactions and depth-induced wave breaking
	are added. In contrast to other third-generation wave models, the
	numerical propagation scheme is implicit, which implies that the
	computations are more economic in shallow water. The model results
	agree well with analytical solutions, laboratory observations, and

	Abstract = {This paper describes a practical procedure for predicting the probability
	distributions of long-term shoreline erosion. It treats the dynamical
	response of the shoreline over time as that of a time-dependent stochastic
	system. The input to the system are the long-term wave climate and
	shoreline properties while the output of the system are the probability
	distributions of the maximum shoreline recession within any prescribed
	time period. The procedure enables the combined effect of the longshore
	and cross-shore sediment transport processes on the shoreline erosion
	to be taken into account as both processes are generally responsible
	for the maximum shoreline recession. A series of simulations using
	idealised long-term wave distributions which have relatively narrow
	directional spread was carried out to evaluate the capability of
	the method. Based on these simulations it was found that both the
	distributions and variability of wave climates have significant influence
	on the predicted shoreline erosion probability distributions while
	the chronology effect is less significant, especially for long simulation
	time.},

@article{Dongeren2008,
	Abstract = {A data-model assimilation method (called #Beach##Wizard#) is presented
	with which the nearshore subtidal bathymetry can be accurately estimated
	based on video-derived observations of wave roller dissipation and
	variation of the intertidal shoreline, and/or radar-derived observations
	of wave celerity. Using many consecutive images, these observed properties
	are compared with numerical model results, and through a simple,
	optimal least-squares estimator approach the estimated bathymetry
	is adjusted gradually for each image in order to improve the fit
	between model output and observations. The key advantages of the
	technique are that it is based on multiple sources of information
	(i.e., different remote sensors and/or data products), depends on
	only a few free parameters (to which the model results are insensitive),
	and shows good skill. Herein, the technique is applied to a synthetic
	case and two sets of field data from sites at Duck, NC (USA) and
	Egmond (The Netherlands). The method, which may be extended with
	observations of other properties from other sources than the three
	described in this paper, can deliver coastal state information (i.e.,
	simultaneous updates of bathymetry, waves, and currents) with high
	temporal and spatial resolution and can be used in conjunction with
	or instead of in-situ measured data.},

@article{Hall2002,
	Abstract = {Probabilistic methods provide a means of demonstrating the potential
	variability in predictions of coastal cliff recession. They form
	the basis for risk-based land use planning, cliff management and
	engineering decision-making. A range of probabilistic methods for
	predicting soft coastal cliff recession has now been developed, including
	statistical techniques, process-based simulation and structured use
	of expert judgement. A new episodic stochastic simulation model is
	introduced, which models the duration between cliff falls as a gamma
	process and fall size as a log-normal distribution. The method is
	applied to cliff recession data from a coastal site in the UK using
	maximum likelihood and Bayesian parameter estimation techniques.
	The Bayesian parameter estimation method enables expert geomorphological
	assessment of the local landslide characteristics and measurements
	of individual cliff falls to be combined with sparse historic records
	of cliff recession. An episodic simulation model is often preferable
	to conventional regression models, which are based on assumptions
	that are seldom consistent with the physical process of cliff recession.},

@article{Hawkes2002,
	Abstract = {On coasts with high tidal ranges, or subject to high surges, both
	still water levels and waves can be important in assessing flood
	risk; their relative importance depends on location and on the type
	of sea defence. The simultaneous occurrence of large waves and a
	high still water level is therefore important in estimating their
	combined effect on sea defences. Wave period can also be important
	in assessing run-up and overtopping, and so it is useful also to
	have information on the joint distribution of wave height and period.
	Unless the variables are either completely independent or completely
	dependent, multivariate extremes are difficult to predict directly
	from observa-tional data, as there may be too few events of the relevant
	type amongst the observations.In the past, the fitting and extrapolation
	of the dependence functions between the variables has often involved
	complicated and/or subjective approaches. This paper presents a method
	for joint probability analysis, using a Monte Carlo simulation approach,
	based on distributions fitted to water level,wave height and wave
	steepness, and to the dependence between them.},

	Abstract = {Over the past 25 years, optical remote sensing has been developed
	into a very useful tool for sampling the nearshore environment, principally
	through the use of Argus Stations. However, the capabilities of such
	systems as scientific tools depend on an understanding of the physics
	of the camera as an optical sensor (including a detailed knowledge
	of accuracies and resolution) and of the relationship of optical
	signals to the geophysical signals they represent. This paper describes
	the components of Argus Stations with an emphasis on quantitative
	characterization of the accuracies and resolution of system components.
	Algorithms for estimation of a range of important nearshore measurements
	are discussed and their accuracies and ground-truth test results
	referenced. References to a number of key examples of Argus-based
	contributions to the scientific literature are cited. Since Argus
	technology serves as the basis for the CoastView Program, the technical
	capabilities described below are part of the foundation of CoastView

	Abstract = {Coastal erosion hotspots are defined as sections of coast that exhibit
	significantly higher rates of erosion than adjacent areas. This paper
	describes the spatial and temporal characteristics of a recently
	identified type of coastal erosion hotspot, which forms in response
	to storms on uninterrupted sandy coasts largely free from human intervention.
	These are referred to here as reversing storm hotspots because the
	erosion is reversed by accretion of a similar magnitude to the storm-induced
	erosion. The accretion occurs within a few days or weeks of fair
	weather after the storm. Reversing storm hotspots observed here,
	on two US east coast beaches, have a longshore length averaging 3.86
	km, a cross-shore excursion (magnitude of erosion or accretion) averaging
	15.4 m, and a time scale of days to weeks associated with individual
	storm events. These spatial and temporal scales clearly distinguish
	reversing storm hotspots from previously described forms of longshore
	variability in erosion, including those attributed to several types
	of shoreline undulations and hotspots associated with long-term shoreline
	change.},

@article{McNinch2004,
	Abstract = {Beach and nearshore morphology, defined primarily by slope and sandbar
	development, is very dynamic and is largely controlled by waves,
	currents and regional sediment characteristics. Results presented
	here challenge this long-established concept and suggest that underlying,
	framework geology may also exert a first-order control on nearshore
	morphology by influencing the stability and/or persistent re-establishment
	of large-scale sandbar morphology and position as well as surface
	sediment characteristics. Repeated sub-bottom chirp and swath bathymetry
	surveys of the nearshore (2-10 m depths) covering over 56 km of the
	North Carolina Outer Banks and Southeastern Virginia indicate the
	following: (1) development of shore-oblique sandbars adjacent to
	large gravel outcrops that are surface exposures of the underlying
	geologic strata, (2) identical re-development or sustained maintenance
	of large-scale sandbar morphology and position before and after very
	energetic conditions, (3) vertical and horizontal heterogeneity of
	lithology and grain-size and a minimum volume of sand, ranging from
	0 to 1.5 m thick, and (4) close spatial alignment between the location
	of outcrops/shore-oblique bars and shoreline erosional hotspots.
	A hypothesis is proposed from these findings that links framework
	geology to bar morphodynamics and sorted bedforms and, ultimately,
	erosional hotspots. Sediment transport and shoreline evolution models
	based solely on waves and currents and an assumption of unlimited
	and uniform sediment may be inadequate in similar heterogeneous,
	sand-limited regions.},

	Abstract = {A non-linear shallow water wave model operating on the time-scale
	of wave groups is compared with measurements of infragravity motions
	on a rip-channel beach to verify the model concepts and assess the
	model performance. The measurements were obtained during the RIP-current
	EXperiment (RIPEX) in concert with the Steep Beach Experiment (SBE)
	performed at Sand City, Monterey Bay, CA, during the spring of 2001.
	The nearshore bathymetry was made up of shore-connected shoals incised
	by relatively narrow rip-channels spaced approximately 125 m apart.
	The comparison considers a 20-day period during which significant
	changes in both the offshore wave climate and nearshore bathymetry
	occurred. The temporal variation in infragravity conditions during
	the experiment is strong, with computational results typically explaining
	70% to 80% of the observed infragravity motions within the nearshore.
	In contrast to the temporal variation, the alongshore spatial variation
	in infragravity intensity during the experiment is generally weak,
	even though the underlying bathymetry shows strong depth variations.
	Model computations suggest preferential coupling between the computed
	edge wave motions and the quasi-periodic bathymetry is present, a
	prerequisite for strong spatial variability. However, the infragravity
	field is dominated by cross-shore infragravity motions, which are
	only weakly coupled to the quasi-periodic bathymetry, resulting in
	a weak alongshore variability of the total infragravity motions.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents results of experimental and mathematical modelling
	of beach and dune erosion under storm events. Re-analysis of the
	experimental results on dune erosion in small-scale and large-scale
	flumes shows that the dune erosion for extreme conditions is somewhat
	smaller than that based on earlier analysis results. Dune erosion
	caused by wave impact has been modelled by a cross-shore profile
	model (CROSMOR-model), which is based on a [`]wave by wave' modelling
	approach solving the wave energy equation for each individual wave.
	The model has been applied to the recent Deltaflume experiments on
	dune erosion. The three main processes affecting dune erosion have
	been taken into account: the generation of low-frequency effects,
	the production of extra turbulence due to wave breaking and wave
	collision and the sliding of the dune face due to wave impact. The
	calibrated model can very well simulate the observed dune erosion
	above the storm surge level during storm events in small-scale facilities,
	large-scale facilities and in the protoype (1953 storm in The Netherlands)
	using the same model settings. The mathematical model results have
	been used to develop a new simplified dune erosion rule.},

	Abstract = {Over time scales of hundreds to thousands of years, the net longshore
	sand transport direction along the central California coast has been
	driven to the south by North Pacific winter swell. In contrast, during
	the El Ni{\~n}o winter of 1997-1998, comparisons of before and after
	airborne lidar surveys showed sand was transported from south to
	north and accumulated on the south sides of resistant headlands bordering
	pocket beaches. This resulted in significant beach erosion at the
	south ends of pocket beaches and deposition in the north ends. Coincident
	with the south-to-north redistribution of sand, shoreline morphology
	became prominently cuspate with longshore wavelengths of 400-700
	m. The width and elevation of beaches were least where maximum shoreline
	erosion occurred, preferentially exposing cliffs to wave attack.
	The resulting erosional hotspots typically were located in the embayments
	of giant cusps in the southern end of the pocket beaches. The observed
	magnitude of sea cliff retreat, which reached 14 m, varied with the
	number of hours that extreme wave runup exceeded certain thresholds
	representing the protective capacity of the beach during the El Ni{\~n}o
	winter. A threshold representing the width of the beach performed
	better than a threshold representing the elevation of the beach.
	The magnitude of cliff erosion can be scaled using a simple model
	based on the cross-shore distance that extreme wave runup exceeded
	the pre-winter cliff position. Cliff erosion appears to be a balance
	between terrestrial mass wasting processes, which tend to decrease
	the cliff slope, and wave attack, which removes debris and erodes
	the cliff base increasing the cliff slope.},

@article{Stockdon2007,
	Abstract = {The vulnerability of a beach to extreme coastal change during a hurricane
	can be estimated by comparing the relative elevations of storm-induced
	water levels to those of the dune or berm. A simple model that defines
	the coastal response based on these elevations was used to hindcast
	the potential impact regime along a 50-km stretch of the North Carolina
	coast to the landfalls of Hurricane Bonnie on August 27, 1998, and
	Hurricane Floyd on September 16, 1999. Maximum total water levels
	at the shoreline were calculated as the sum of modeled storm surge,
	astronomical tide, and wave runup, estimated from offshore wave conditions
	and the local beach slope using an empirical parameterization. Storm
	surge and wave runup each accounted for ~ 48% of the signal (the
	remaining 4% is attributed to astronomical tides), indicating that
	wave-driven process are a significant contributor to hurricane-induced
	water levels. Expected water levels and lidar-derived measures of
	pre-storm dune and berm elevation were used to predict the spatially-varying
	storm-impact regime: swash, collision, or overwash. Predictions were
	compared to the observed response quantified using a lidar topography
	survey collected following hurricane landfall. The storm-averaged
	mean accuracy of the model in predicting the observed impact regime
	was 55.4%, a significant improvement over the 33.3% accuracy associated
	with random chance. Model sensitivity varied between regimes and
	was highest within the overwash regime where the accuracies were
	84.2% and 89.7% for Hurricanes Bonnie and Floyd, respectively. The
	model not only allows for prediction of the general coastal response
	to storms, but also provides a framework for examining the longshore-variable
	magnitudes of observed coastal change. For Hurricane Bonnie, shoreline
	and beach volume changes within locations that experienced overwash
	or dune erosion were two times greater than locations where wave
	runup was confined to the foreshore (swash regime). During Hurricane
	Floyd, this pattern became more pronounced as magnitudes of change
	were four times greater within the overwash regime than in the swash
	regime. Comparisons of pre-storm topography to a calm weather survey
	collected one year after Hurricane Floyd's landfall show long-term
	beach volume loss at overwash locations. Here, the volume of sand
	eroded from the beach was balanced by the volume of overwash deposits,
	indicating that the majority of the sand removed from the beach was
	transported landward across the island rather than being transported
	offshore. In overwash locations, sand was removed from the nearshore
	system and unavailable for later beach recovery, resulting in a more
	permanent response than observed within the other regimes. These
	results support the predictive capabilities of the storm scaling
	model and illustrate that the impact regimes provide a framework
	for explaining the longshore-variable coastal response to hurricanes.},

@article{ThieldeVries2008,
	Abstract = {Large-scale physical model tests were conducted with different wave
	periods to examine the physical processes driving dune erosion. The
	model tests have been carried out in a flume (2DV) with a sandy dune
	exposed to extreme surge and wave conditions [Van Gent, M.R.A., Van
	Thiel de Vries, J.S.M., Coeveld, E.M., De Vroeg, J.H. and Van de
	Graaff, J., 2008. Large-scale dune erosion tests to study the effect
	of wave periods. Coastal Engineering. doi:10.1016/j.coastaleng.2008.04.003.].
	Detailed measurements in time and space of water pressure, flow velocities
	and sediment concentrations were performed in the near shore area.
	The data revealed that both short- and long waves are important to
	inner surf hydrodynamics. Depth averaged flows are directed offshore
	and increase towards the shore line. The corresponding mean sediment
	concentrations rise sharply towards the dune face (up to 50�g/l near
	the bed). The strong increase in the mean sediment concentration
	towards the dune face correlates well with the maximum wave surface
	slope which in turn is coupled to both the pressure gradient and
	the near-bed wave-breaking induced turbulence. Analysis shows that
	the pressure gradient is only partially coupled to the flow acceleration
	suggesting that the latter cannot always be used as a proxy for the
	first. Weak correlation is obtained with the near-bed flows related
	to the bed shear stress. Tests with a larger wave period resulted
	in a larger dune erosion volume. During these tests more wave energy
	(combined incident and infragravity waves) reached the dune face,
	but more importantly, this wave energy is dissipated by fewer waves
	resulting in more intense wave breakers and steeper wave fronts.
	It is therefore expected that the wave-breaking induced near-bed
	turbulence increases resulting in significantly higher (O(100%))
	mean sediment concentrations. In addition the mean flow velocities
	are comparable, yielding a substantially larger offshore directed
	sediment transport capacity. This increase in offshore directed transport
	is only partially compensated by a concurrent increase in the wave
	related onshore transport capacity associated with intrawave processes,
	resulting in a net increase in the dune erosion rate.},

@article{Thornton2007,
	Abstract = {Dune erosion is shown to occur at the embayment of beach mega-cusps
	O(200 m alongshore) that are associated with rip currents. The beach
	is the narrowest at the embayment of the mega-cusps allowing the
	swash of large storm waves coincident with high tides to reach the
	toe of the dune, to undercut the dune and to cause dune erosion.
	Field measurements of dune, beach, and rip current morphology are
	acquired along an 18 km shoreline in southern Monterey Bay, California.
	This section of the bay consists of a sandy shoreline backed by extensive
	dunes, rising to heights exceeding 40 m. There is a large increase
	in wave height going from small wave heights in the shadow of a headland,
	to the center of the bay where convergence of waves owing to refraction
	over the Monterey Bay submarine canyon results in larger wave heights.
	The large alongshore gradient in wave height results in a concomitant
	alongshore gradient in morphodynamic scale. The strongly refracted
	waves and narrow bay aperture result in near normal wave incidence,
	resulting in well-developed, persistent rip currents along the entire
	shoreline. The alongshore variations of the cuspate shoreline are
	found significantly correlated with the alongshore variations in
	rip spacing at 95% confidence. The alongshore variations of the volume
	of dune erosion are found significantly correlated with alongshore
	variations of the cuspate shoreline at 95% confidence. Therefore,
	it is concluded the mega-cusps are associated with rip currents and
	that the location of dune erosion is associated with the embayment
	of the mega-cusp.},

@article{Veen2005,
	Abstract = {The present paper, ``Eb- en vloedschaarsystemen in de Nederlandse getijwateren''
	(Ebb- and Flood-Channel Systems in the Dutch Tidal Waters), which
	was published in 1950, should be considered as Van Veen's most important
	publication since his thesis. It summarizes the results of 20 years
	of intensive study of estuarine and tidal-basin mor-phodynamics in
	The Netherlands. Unfortunately, Van Veen's paper was published in
	Dutch, with only a brief summary in English. Luckily, the figure
	captions were given in both Dutch and English, allowing international
	researchers coming across the paper to read it as a kind of ``cartoon.''
	Understandably though, the paper has received very limited recognition
	in the international literature. We have seized this occasion to
	publish an English version of Van Veen's paper. The paper is testimony
	to Van Veen's keen observational and artistic skills. His approach
	is nearly ``Da Vincian,'' in the sense that he is not only a fascinated
	observer of nature, but a sharp one as well, and he tries to capture
	the essentials of the dynamic behavior of complex coastal systems
	in apparently simple sketches. Many of the natural systems that Van
	Veen studied have been regulated since; thus, this paper contains
	a set of irreplaceable, high-quality observations on the natural
	dynamics of tidal systems. It forms an excellent introduction to
	the study of channel dynamics in estuaries, tidal inlets, and tidal
	basins.},
